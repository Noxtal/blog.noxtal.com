 Write-up on CTFlearn's challenge 305 - Vigenere Cipher. Blorby!
 Challenge author: yakatoi.

# Challenge
Crypto, 20 points
> The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. <br/><br/>I’m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy <br/><br/>gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}

# Solution
This challenge is all about the [Vigenère Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). This cipher has been invented by the French cryptographer [Blaise de Vigenère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_de_Vigen%C3%A8re) in 1553.

Its base concept is simple: all the letters from the plaintext are shifted in the alphabet with the corresponding letters from the key.
For instance, `B` shifted by `C` becomes `D` (shifted by 2) because `C` is at position 2 in the alphabet (`A` is at position 0). 
If the plaintext is longer than the key, repeat the key until it fits the right length. Below is a little scheme I have made describing that.

For that challenge, the two needed components are given: the ciphertext (`gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}`) and the key `blorpy`.
The curly brackets won't be affected by the cipher, as they are not part of the alphabet.

Without further ado, let's open up [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to solve this challenge. CyberChef is an app allowing us to perform crypto functions (and more) quickly in the browser.

Go into the *Operations* menu, search for "Vigenère Decode" and select the corresponding block. Drag it into the *Recipe*.
Enter the key in the *Key* option and the ciphertext as input. 

The flag should now be printed in the *Output* box.
