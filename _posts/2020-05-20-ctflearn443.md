# Solution
The quote in the challenge's description is a reference to Bacon's cipher. Its name is not about the food but it's about the creator of this cipher, the English philosopher [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon) (1561-1626). The text under it is the ciphertext we need to decode to get the flag.

A Bacon's cipher is a [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) technique, a way of hiding a message is some text. It encodes every letter as following:

| Letter | Code  | Letter | Code  |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| A      | AAAAA | N      | ABBAA |
| B      | AAAAB | O      | ABBAB |
| C      | AAABA | P      | ABBBA |
| D      | AAABB | Q      | ABBBB |
| E      | AABAA | R      | BAAAA |
| F      | AABAB | S      | BAAAB |
| G      | AABBA | T      | BAABA |
| H      | AABBB | U, V   | BAABB |
| I, J   | ABAAA | W      | BABAA |
| K      | ABAAB | X      | BABAB |
| L      | ABABA | Y      | BABBA |
| M      | ABABB | Z      | BABBB |

Let's open up [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to solve this challenge. CyberChef is an app allowing us to perform crypto functions (and more) quickly in the browser.

In the *Operations* menu, search for "Bacon Cipher Decode" (as it is the operation we want to do) in the *Operations* menu. Take it and drag it into the *Recipe* box. Change the *Translation* option to *A/B*, because our ciphertext contains either "A"s or "B"s. Finally, enter the ciphertext in the *Input* field and it should output the flag.
